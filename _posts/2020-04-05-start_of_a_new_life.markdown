I have decided to make a decision in my life that would further advance my life towards my goals and aspirations. I chose to join a coding bootcamp, more specifically The Flat Iron School, to further enhance my career path with the pursuit of my bachelors degree in computer science. Ever since I was a kid, my dream was always to have a startup. My reasons for picking computer science as a degree path back then was soley for my entrepreneurship spirits and needs.

I chose this coding bootcamp towards my college graduation to polish my skills, and work in the field to get more experience. I will then launch my startup at the right time and place. I am looking forward to what the next few months will bring to me. I cannot wait to learn more about software engineering and coding my own stuff. I have no regrets choosing this course and its not even over.

Overall, I am choosing this course as an enhancement towards my life, hoping to get the best skill in a short time period. A skill that will benefit me in the personal scale level and all the way to the workforce level. I cannot wait to implement it for multiple needs. I am also extremely excited for the startup I am going to launch alongside other developers and being able to discuss/implement actions with them. I cannot wait for the times to come and I am glad I chose this course.
